## Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of e-commerce, analyzing vast amounts of sales data is essential for identifying trends, improving product performance, and gaining customer insights. This project aims to develop a comprehensive sales dashboard using Power BI to help a leading e-commerce retailer make informed decisions based on the analysis of over 128,000 sales orders.


### Steps followed 

- Data Preparation:

    Loaded sales data consisting of 128,000+ orders, including information about products, customers, sales regions, and order details.Cleaned and transformed raw data to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis.
- Data Modeling:

    Created relationships between tables (e.g., product, customer, and order tables) to enable a structured analysis.
    Applied DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions to compute sales metrics like overall sale, sales amount, and customer reviews, returns and losses.
    For ex, Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average and total calculation. Neither were they displayed, being displayed as 0.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating averages, sums, sales units, etc blank values are ignored.

- Visualization Design:

    Developed interactive and dynamic reports to visualize key metrics such as sales trends, product performance, and customer segmentation.
    Integrated visual elements like bar charts, line graphs, KPIs, and slicers to create an intuitive user experience.
    Added filters to allow stakeholders to drill down into specific product categories, time periods, and customer demographics.
- Real-Time Metrics:

    Implemented real-time sales tracking through dynamic visual elements that display the latest sales numbers and product performance.
- Dashboard Optimization:

    Optimized the performance of the dashboard by ensuring efficient data refresh and query processing.
           
-  Added ToolTips:

    Created new page and for every product a short summary page was added as a tooltip to give the basic idea of it's sales.
